    "# Intro: BotOp (Robot Operation) interface\n",
    "\n",
    "BotOp (=robot operation) defines a very narrow interface to control a real or simulated robot. While in initial years we tried all kinds of other interfaces (ROS-given, operational space control interfaces, controller state machines, etc), this one seems most pragmatic, simple, transparent, and compatible to our research work at the LIS research team. There is no ROS or complex IPC involved, just a few threads (communicating with hardwares) interfaced via BotOp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface essentially provides move methods to set/overwrite a spline reference for the robot. (Also compliance around the reference can be set.) Gripper methods to operate grippers. And getImage.. methods grab images or point clouds from the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interface is quite different to a more *generic physical simulation* interface. If you're interested in the latter (e.g. to implement a gym environment) look at the `Simulation` tutorial. BotOp uses a `Simulation` (optionally) as an underlying engine, but is quite different in that it is wrapped as a real-time threaded process that emulates the specific BotOp interface to a real robot -- to make it swappable with a real robot. If BotOp is run in simulation mode, the simulation can be run in many different modes: \n",

    "- a physics simulator with physics for objects but still kinematic robot\n",
