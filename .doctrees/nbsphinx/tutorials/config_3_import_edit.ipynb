The key benefit is that `watchFile` reloads and re-displays the file whenever it is externally modified (it watches the file's inode). That enables interactive editing. It also allows you to return information on objects you point on (their name and attributes), which helps a lot to inspect models. It also reports on collisions in the configuration.\n",
