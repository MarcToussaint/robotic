Robotic Control Interface & Manipulation Planning Library
=========================================================

This is a python library to operate a real or simulated robot, work
with robot/world configurations, compute differentiable features,
formulate and solve constrained optimization problems (for inverse
kinematics, path optimization, and manipulation planning), and
interfacing to various physical simulation engines. These python
bindings were developed for easier access to the `underlying C++ code
base <https://github.com/MarcToussaint/rai>`_, esp. for teaching and
students. This code base is how we, in the `Learning & Intelligent
Systems Lab <https://argmin.lis.tu-berlin.de/>`_, operate our robots.
