So the box is now just a sub-frame of the table, which is a sub-frame of the 'world' frame. (In general, this is how composed objects are represented, with one parent frame that may have multiple child frames carrying shapes and/or inertia.) In addition, the box as a child is giving mass to it's root frame (here the 'world' frame) -- therefore, while 'world' (with table shape) was previously a static object in physx, it now becomes dynamic, with two attached shapes. Again, setting verbose=2 reports this."
