    "All methods to compute paths or configurations solve constrained optimization problems. To use them, you need to learn to define constrained optimization problems. Some definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An objective defines either a sum-of-square cost term, or an equality constraint, or an inequality constraint in the optimization problem. An objective is defined by its type and its feature. The type can be `sos` (sum-of-squares), `eq`, or `ineq`, referring to the three cases.\n",
    "* A feature is a (differentiable mapping) from the decision variable (the full path, or robot configuration) to a feature space. If the feature space is, e.g., 3-dimensional, this defines 3 sum-of-squares terms, or 3 inequality, or 3 equality constraints, one for each dimension. For instance, the feature can be the 3-dim robot hand position in the 15th time slice of a path optimization problem. If you put an equality constraint on this feature, then this adds 3 equality constraints to the overall path optimization problem.\n",
    "* A feature is defined by the keyword for the feature map (e.g., `pos` for position), typically by a set of frame names that tell which objects we refer to (e.g., `pr2L` for the left hand of the pr2), optionally some modifiers (e.g., a scale or target, which linearly transform the feature map), and the set of configuration IDs or time slices the feature is to be computed from (e.g., `confs=[15]` if the feat is to be computed from the 15th time slice in a path optimization problem).\n",
    "* In path optimization problems, we often want to add objectives for a whole time interval rather than for a single time slice or specific configuration. E.g., avoid collisions from start to end. When adding objectives to the optimization problem we can specify whole intervals, with `times=[1., 2.]`, so that the objective is added to each configuration in this time interval.\n",
    "* Some features, especially velocity and acceleration, refer to a tuple of (consecutive) configurations. E.g., when you impose an acceleration feature, you need to specify `confs=[13, 14, 15]`. Or if you use `times=[1.,1.]`, the acceleration features is computed from the configuration that corresponds to time=1 and the two configurations *before*.\n",
    "* All kinematic feature maps (that depend on only one configuration) can be modified to become a velocity or acceleration features. E.g., the position feature map can be modified to become a velocity or acceleration feature.\n",
    "* The `sos`, `eq`, and `ineq` always refer to the feature map to be *zero*, e.g., constraining all features to be equal to zero with `eq`. This is natural for many features, esp. when they refer to differences (e.g. `posDiff` or `posRel`, which compute the relative position between two frames). However, when one aims to constrain the feature to a non-zero constant value, one can modify the objective with a `target` specification.\n",
    "* Finally, all features can be rescaled with a `scale` specification. Rescaling changes the costs that arise from `sos` objectives. Rescaling also has significant impact on the convergence behavior for `eq` and `ineq` constraints. As a guide: scale constraints so that if they *would* be treated as squared penalties (squaredPenalty optim mode, to be made accessible) convergence to reasonable approximate solutions is efficient. Then the AugLag will also converge efficiently to precise constraints."
